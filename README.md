Writing an real-time WordHunt solver.

The native python implementation runs fast enough, but I'm writing stuff in C just for practice/exposure.

Uses the 2019 Collins Scrabble word list, which can be found in [this thread](https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/38366/latest-collins-scrabble-words-list-in-text-file).
